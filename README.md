# dotfiles

These are my ever-helpful dotfiles (rather obviously).

## Folders

### other_people_bashrc

Contains other people's bashrc[s]. Helpful for referencing sometimes. Etc.

### temp

Contains wip helper shell scripts. Hopefully this folder will become empty in the near future.

## Files

bashrc, inputrc, aliases, and vimrc are all pretty self-explanatory.

### neocompletion

A script to provide autocompletion for Dimensional Mechanics' CLI tool, neopulse.

### shift_bs.ahk

Switches caps lock key to CTRL, and vice versa on Windows computers.

##### Credit goes to my brother for giving me his bashrc to start off with
###### (Which is where basically all of the git aliases and functions came from. I don't actually use git enough to have made/needed those (yet).)
